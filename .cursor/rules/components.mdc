# React Component Guidelines

## Component Organization

- `components/client/appointments/` - Patient-facing
- `components/dashboard/` - Provider dashboard
- `components/auth/` - Authentication
- `components/ui/` - Reusable UI components
- Separate client/server components for PHI protection

## Critical Requirements

- **PRIORITY**: Migrate all Yup to Zod in [lib/validation.ts](mdc:lib/validation.ts)
- Use Zustand for global state [store/appointment/](mdc:store/appointment/)
- Use TanStack Query for server state
- Use Formik for complex medical forms
- Use TanStack Table for data tables, Recharts for visualization
- HeroUI components from [tailwind.config.ts](mdc:tailwind.config.ts)

## PHI Security

- Never store PHI in unencrypted component state
- Mask sensitive data in display
- Implement session timeout handling
- Add audit logging for sensitive operations
- Use error boundaries to prevent data leakage
